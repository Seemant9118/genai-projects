# GENAI-Projects 🚀🤖

A collection of **GenAI / LLM-based projects** that I’m building and improving step-by-step as I learn more about AI, system design, and modern frontend development.

This repository is not a single app — it’s a **growing workspace** where I keep adding new projects, features, and experiments over time.

## ✨ What is this repo?

**GENAI-Projects** contains multiple mini-projects related to:

- AI Chatbots (ChatGPT/Gemini-like)
